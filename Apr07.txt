a. Find the total revenue generated based on category:


sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://sqoopdb.slbdh.cloudlabs.com/ramuvelugodutigeranalytic --username ramuvelugodutigeranalytic --password ramuvelugodutigeranalyticncx5v --target-dir /user/ramuvelugodutigeranalytic/07Apr2022/sqoop/revenue --query "select category,sum(amount) as revenue from walmarttransactions where \$CONDITIONS group by category" -m 1

b. Find the total sum and count of transactions done by credit and cash

sqoop eval --connect jdbc:mysql://sqoopdb.slbdh.cloudlabs.com/ramuvelugodutigeranalytic --username ramuvelugodutigeranalytic --password ramuvelugodutigeranalyticncx5v --query "select txntype,count(*) as numberoftxn from walmarttransactions group by txntype"

c. Find the category that has the highest sales


sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://sqoopdb.slbdh.cloudlabs.com/ramuvelugodutigeranalytic --username ramuvelugodutigeranalytic --password ramuvelugodutigeranalyticncx5v --target-dir /user/ramuvelugodutigeranalytic/07Apr2022/sqoop/revenue1 --query "select category,Max(sales)  from walmarttransactions where \$CONDITIONS group by category" -m 1

d. Find the category that has the lowest sales

      ** select txntype, sum(amount),count(amount) from txns1 group by txntype;

select category ,sum(amount) as sal from txns1 group by category order by sal desc limit 1; 

 select category ,sum(amount) as sal from txns1 group by category order by sal asc limit 1;

select avg(basepay) as avg_basepay from final_assn4;


**2. What is the highest amount of OvertimePay in the dataset ? **
select max(overtimepay) as highest_overtimepay from final_assn4;


**3. What is the job title of JOSEPH DRISCOLL ? Note: Use all caps, otherwise you may get an answer that doesn't match up (there is also a lowercase Joseph Driscoll). **
select jobtitle from final_assn4 where employeename="JOSEPH DRISCOLL";

4.How much does JOSEPH DRISCOLL make (including benefits)? **
select totalpaybenefits from final_assn4 where employeename='JOSEPH DRISCOLL';

5. What is the name of highest paid person (including benefits)?**
select employeename,totalpaybenefits from final_assn4 order by totalpaybenefits desc limit 1;


**6. What is the name of lowest paid person (including benefits)? Do you notice something strange about how much he or she is paid?**

select employeename,totalpaybenefits from final_assn4 order by totalpaybenefits limit 1;

**7. What was the average (mean) BasePay of all employees per year? (2011-2014) ? **

Select year,avg(basepay) as avg_basepay from final_assn4 group by year order by year;

**8. How many unique job titles are there?
select count(distinct jobtitle) as count_unique_jobtitles from final_assn4;



9.  ** What are the top 5 most common jobs? **
select jobtitle, count(*) counter from final_assn4 group by jobtitle order by counter desc limit 5;



**10. How many Job Titles were represented by only one person in 2013? (e.g. Job Titles with only one occurence in 2013?) **


Select count(*) from (select jobtitle,count(*) counter from final_assn4 where year=2013 group by jobtitle having counter=1) t;


**11. How many people have the word Chief in their job title? (This is pretty tricky) **


select count(*) as num_jobtitles from final_assn4 where jobtitle like '%Chief%';


**12. Bonus: Is there a correlation between length of the Job Title string and Salary? **


select corr(length(jobtitle),totalpaybenefits) as correlation from final_assn4;
